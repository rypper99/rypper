    <p>Reason why 44 no good</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Avoids going into the corners</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is a contested puck, he will choke up and let the player beat him to the puck</li>
          <li>He then tries to stick check the puck away</li>
          <li>BAD: gave up chance to gain possesion, now best best is to knock it away</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Ineffective dealing with players infront of net</li>
        <ul>
          <li>He is not strong enough to engage with any players, he often is tossed around like a 10 year old girl</li>
          <li>At times, he totally lost in front of the net and doesn't cover anyone</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Often will leave defensive zone before the puck</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A defenceman should NEVER be crossing the blue line before the puck</li>
          <li>If there is any type of turnover, those left in the zone are out numbered</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Doesn't offer an outlet for his partner</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A defenceman should put himself in postion for a pass as an outlet for his partner</li>
          <li>I have seen him pass to his partner in the corner and then go to the front of his net.  Horrible play, leaves partner
            in bad situation</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Doesn't do anything special for an outlet pass</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You will notice he is often passing to his partner to make the pass</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Most defencemen's play is worse when playing with him</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It seems only 2 can play with him with out his game falling off a cliff</li>
          <li>Since 44 doesn't carry his weight, makes it difficult for his partner</li>
        </ul>

      <li>He is a weak skater</li>
        <ul>
          <li>When makes a bad pinch or gets caught in offensive zone NEVER has enough speed to catch anyone</li>
          <li>Worse even is he seems to float back into his zone when he should be chasing + catching the guy</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Why is he a media darling?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I beleive any player who talks to the media regularly is often portrayed favourably in the media</li>
        </ul>
