	<h1>Estate Planning: who you need</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>lawyer - estate planning (set up a trust for a beneficiary with a disability)
		<li>accountant - income tax planning
		<li>advisor - investment planning
		<li>professional financial planner (offer advice on estate plan including trusts and wills)
	</ul>

	<h1>Estate Planning when leaving an inheritance to a beneficiary with a disability</h1>
		<ul>
		<li>If you leave a significant inheritance to a beneficiary with a disability, the tax savings to allocate more income to their tax return instead of having it taxed to the trust could be more than the government benefits they receive. But that would be a consideration for the trustee for the testamentary trust and their tax advisors after your death</li>
		<li>Depending how the trust funds are invested, keep in mind that different types of investments are taxed differently. Canadian dividends are grossed up by 38% when reported on a personal tax return and then the taxpayer claims a tax credit to reduce the tax. But it can make the relevant line number on their tax return that is used to government benefits appear to show a higher income</li>
		<li>Capital gains are only 50% taxable. So, this can be a tax-effective way to invest generally, as well as for those who receive means-tested government benefits. Different types of investments generate more tax-deferred income or re-characterize dividends and interest to be taxed in the future as capital gains, so an investment strategy can help preserve federal or provincial supports</li> 
		<li>A lawyer who specializes in estate planning is probably is best for planning estate</li>
		<li>Make sure you select a trustee for the trust who you believe can seek out the professional input after you are gone to take proper financial care of your disabled family member</li>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.moneysense.ca/glossary/what-is-a-trust/">What is a trust?</a></li>
		<li>enabling income splitting between the trust and beneficiary</li>
		<li>A trust may be able to allocate a limited amount of income to a beneficiary with a disability without infringing upon government benefits or may be able to allocate tax-free principal. </li>
		<li>Not all accountants are well-versed with trust taxation, so tax advice once a trust is active is important</li>
		<li>Taxes</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Taxes arise for a trust based on the income it earns</li>
			<li>the income can be allocated to a beneficiary based on income tax strategy and other practical considerations</li>
			<li>income of the trust is taxed at graduated marginal tax rate (like individual tax payer)</li>
			<li>A trust files an income tax return just like an individual taxpayer</li>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>testamentary</strong> vs. <strong>inter vivos trust</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>testamentary trust (after death) included in your will</li>
					<ul>
						<li>no longer get gratuated tax rates</li>
						<li>all trust income taxed at highest marginal rate</li>
					</ul>
				<li>inter vivos trust ("amoung the living") established during your life</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<h5>Qualified Disability Trust (QDT)</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>can only be a testamentary trust (i.e. set up through your will)</li>
			<li>to qualify as a QDT the beneficiary must receive the Disability Tax Credit</li>
			<li>a properly drafted trust—that meets the criteria of a qualified disability trust (QDT)—is that it pays tax at graduated tax rates, just like an individual would. Otherwise, a trust may be subject to the top tax rate on all its income</li>
		</ul>


	<h5>Henson Trust</h5>
	<ul>

			Henson Trusts (The Navigator)</a></li>
		<li>common estate planning tool to provide for beneficiaries with disabilities 
		<li>named after Leonard Henson
			<ul>
			<li>established a discretionary testamentary trust for his disabled daughter
			<li>Her government benefits were terminated as a result of her inheritance
			<li>but the trustees successfully argued in an Ontario court that the funds did not belong to her and were not her assets. 
			</ul>
		<li>Henson trust wording is common in discretionary trusts for beneficiaries with disabilities to help preserve government benefits that are based on assets or income.
		<li>Some estate lawyers may be more experienced with the intricacies of these types of trusts than others.
	</ul>

	<h1>How to use an RDSP for estate planning?</h1>
		<ul>
		<li>RDSP can be invested on a tax deferred basis. It can be opened up until December 31 of the year a beneficiary turns 59. 
		<li>If the beneficiary is 49 or younger, contributions to the account receive additional government grants, and if their income is low, they may also receive government bonds. 
		<li>The grants and bonds can be much higher than the contributions themselves, so this may be very lucrative.
		<li>If the family member is a financially dependent child or grandchild, 
		<li>you can even leave your registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) or registered retirement income fund (RRIF) to a financially dependent child or grandchild upon your death
		<li>some or all of inheritance deposited to their RDSP on a tax-deferred basis. 
		<li>$200,000 lifetime limit for an RDSP account: includes contributions as well as the allowable tax-deferred transfer from an RRSP or RRIF account.
		<li>RDSP generally do not impact government benefits that are based on income thresholds. 
		<li>RRSP/RRIF can be transferred to RDSP to defer tax. Does this need to be specified in will?</li>
