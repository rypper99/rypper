		<h1>Trusts</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.moneysense.ca/glossary/what-is-a-trust/">What is a trust?</a></li>
				<li>enabling income splitting between the trust and beneficiary</li>
				<li>A trust may be able to allocate a limited amount of income to a beneficiary with a disability without infringing upon government benefits or may be able to allocate tax-free principal. </li>
				<li>Not all accountants are well-versed with trust taxation, so tax advice once a trust is active is important</li>
				<li>Trustee required</li>
				<ul>
					<li>choose one who you believe can seek out the professional input to take proper financial care of your disabled family member</li>
				</ul>
				<li>optimize how trust funds are investmented</li>
					<ul>
						<li>different types of investments are taxed differently:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>generate more tax-deferred income</li>
								<li>re-characterize dividends and interest to be taxed in the future as capital gains</li>
							</ul>
						<li>an investment strategy can help preserve federal or provincial supports</li>
						<li>Canadian dividends</li>
							<ul>
								<li>grossed up by 38% when reported on a personal tax return and taxpayer claims a tax credit to reduce the tax</li>
								<li>But this can make the relevant line number on their tax return that is used to government benefits appear to show a higher income</li>
							</ul> 
						<li>Capital Gains</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Capital gains are only 50% taxable. So, this can be a tax-effective way to invest generally, as well as </li>
							<li>for those who receive means-tested government benefits. </li>
						</ul>
						
					</ul>
				<li>Taxes</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Taxes arise for a trust based on the income it earns</li>
					<li>the income can be allocated to a beneficiary based on income tax strategy and other practical considerations</li>
					<li>income of the trust is taxed at graduated marginal tax rate (like individual tax payer)</li>
					<li>A trust files an income tax return just like an individual taxpayer</li>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>testamentary</strong> vs. <strong>inter vivos trust</strong></li>
					<ul>
						<li>testamentary trust (after death) included in your will</li>
							<ul>
								<li>no longer get gratuated tax rates</li>
								<li>all trust income taxed at highest marginal rate</li>
							</ul>
						<li>inter vivos trust ("amoung the living") established during your life</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<h1>Types of Trusts</h1>
			<h5>Qualified Disability Trust (QDT)</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>can only be a testamentary trust (i.e. set up through your will)</li>
					<li>to qualify as a QDT the beneficiary must receive the Disability Tax Credit</li>
					<li>pays tax at graduated tax rates, just like an individual would. Otherwise, a trust may be subject to the top tax rate on all its income</li>
				</ul>

			<h5>Henson Trust</h5>
			<ul>

					Thinking ahead for beneficiaries with disabilities</a></li>
				<li>common estate planning tool to provide for beneficiaries with disabilities 
				<li>named after Leonard Henson
					<ul>
					<li>established a discretionary testamentary trust for his disabled daughter
					<li>Her government benefits were terminated as a result of her inheritance
					<li>but the trustees successfully argued in an Ontario court that the funds did not belong to her and were not her assets. 
					</ul>
				<li>Henson trust wording is common in discretionary trusts for beneficiaries with disabilities to help preserve government benefits that are based on assets or income.
				<li>Some estate lawyers may be more experienced with the intricacies of these types of trusts than others.
			</ul>

			<h5>RDSP (Registered Disability Savings Plan)</h5>
				<ul>
				<li>RDSP can be invested on a tax deferred basis</li>
				<li>Can be opened up until December 31 of the year a beneficiary turns 59</li>
				<li>If the beneficiary is 49 or younger</li>
				<ul>
					<li>contributions to the account receive additional government grants</li>
					<li>if their income is low, they may also receive government bonds</li>
					<li>grants and bonds can be much higher than the contributions themselves, so this may be very lucrative</li>
				</ul>
				<li>you can leave your RRSP or RRIF to a financially dependent child or grandchild upon your death</li>
				<li>inheritance (some or all) can be deposited to their RDSP on a tax-deferred basis</li>
				<li>$200,000 lifetime limit for an RDSP account: includes contributions as well as the allowable tax-deferred transfer from an RRSP or RRIF account</li>
				<li>RDSP generally do not impact government benefits that are based on income thresholds</li>
