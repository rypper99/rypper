				<li>enabling income splitting between the trust and beneficiary</li>
				<li>A trust may be able to allocate a limited amount of income to a beneficiary with a disability without infringing upon government benefits or may be able to allocate tax-free principal. </li>
				<li>Not all accountants are well-versed with trust taxation, so tax advice once a trust is active is important</li>
				<li>Trustee required</li>
				<ul>
					<li>choose one who you believe can seek out the professional input to take proper financial care of your disabled family member</li>
				</ul>
				<li>optimize how trust funds are investmented</li>
					<ul>
						<li>different types of investments are taxed differently:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>generate more tax-deferred income</li>
								<li>re-characterize dividends and interest to be taxed in the future as capital gains</li>
							</ul>
						<li>an investment strategy can help preserve federal or provincial supports</li>
						<li>Canadian dividends</li>
							<ul>
								<li>grossed up by 38% when reported on a personal tax return and taxpayer claims a tax credit to reduce the tax</li>
								<li>But this can make the relevant line number on their tax return that is used to government benefits appear to show a higher income</li>
							</ul> 
						<li>Capital Gains</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Capital gains are only 50% taxable. So, this can be a tax-effective way to invest generally, as well as </li>
							<li>for those who receive means-tested government benefits. </li>
						</ul>
						
					</ul>
				<li>Taxes</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Taxes arise for a trust based on the income it earns</li>
					<li>the income can be allocated to a beneficiary based on income tax strategy and other practical considerations</li>
					<li>income of the trust is taxed at graduated marginal tax rate (like individual tax payer)</li>
					<li>A trust files an income tax return just like an individual taxpayer</li>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>testamentary</strong> vs. <strong>inter vivos trust</strong></li>
					<ul>
						<li>testamentary trust (after death) included in your will</li>
							<ul>
								<li>no longer get gratuated tax rates</li>
								<li>all trust income taxed at highest marginal rate</li>
							</ul>
						<li>inter vivos trust ("amoung the living") established during your life</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>

								<li>be 18 years of age, dependant on another person because of mental or physical infirmity and not have income in
									the beneficiaries taxation year that execeeds the basic personal amount.
								</li>

					<ul>
						<li>trust and preferred beneficary must file a joint election within 90 days of the end of the trust's taxation year</li>
						<li>election may designate any portion of the accumulating income of the trust up to the preferred beneficiary’s “allocable amount”</li>
						<li>preferred beneficiary’s “allocable amount” is equal to the “accumulating income” of the trust except in two circumstances.</li>
							<ol>
								<li>a trust where there is a deemed disposition on the death of a particular beneficiary the allocable amount is deemed to be nil in the year of that beneficiary’s death, such that the preferred beneficiary election is not available in that year</li>
								<li>the allocable amount is also deemed to be nil where the preferred beneficiary’s interest in the trust is solely contingent on the death of another beneficiary who has a capital interest in the trust but does not have an income interest in the trust</li>
							</ol>
						<li>Where a preferred beneficiary election is made, the portion of the accumulating income so designated is included in the income of the preferred beneficiary</li>
						<li>if an amount is paid or made payable to a beneficiary of the trust, that amount is deducted from the income of the trust when calculating the accumulating income</li>
