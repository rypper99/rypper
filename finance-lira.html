		<h2>Strategy</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Unlock 50% of LIRA into RRSP	
			<ul>
			<li>LIRA/LIFrules will vary depending on province
			<li>
			<li>
			<li>
			</ul>
		<li>Yearly transfer from LIF to RRSP/RRIF on tax deferred basis
		<ul>
			<li>Transfer the difference between the maximum LIF payment and the minimum LIF payment directly to an RRSP or RRIF on a tax-deferred basis.
			<li>source: Mark McGrath on Twitter based upon rules in BC
			<li>LIRA/LIF rules will vary depending on province
			<li>Max each year is the GREATER of prescribed maximum set by CRA and your investments returns from the previous year
			<li>Example
				<ul>
				<li>Person is 67 with $500,000 in LRA with a investment gain of $40,000
				<li>CRA prescribed minimum is 4.35% ( $21,750 )
				<li>CRA prescribed maximum is 7.67% ( $38,350 )
				<li>LIRA was up $40,000 last year
				<li>Difference is $18,250 : $40,000 - $21,750
				<li>You can transfer $18,250 to your RRSP or RRIF - tax deferred
				</ul>
			<li>Doing this every year converts a less-liquid asset (your LIF) into a more liquid asset (RRSP/RRIF)
			</ul>
