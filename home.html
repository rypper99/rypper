					<ul>
						<li>Temperature set at installation but may need to be increases as unit gets older</li>
					</ul>

					Is It Better To Flush Or Drain Your Water Heater?</a></li>
				<li>Ryan experience is flushing doesn't add to life of water heater</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p>Furnace</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Warranty</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Need to register furnace so warranty goes from 5 years to 10 years</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Servicing</li>
				<ul>
					<li>After installation, get serviced in 2 years (adjusted during installion for best performance)</li>
					<li>Once warranty up (10 years) get yearly service</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Filters</li>
				<ul>
					<li>recommends using MERV 8 and changing more often (we can buy these at the box stores)</li>
					<li>change every 3 months but check filter and if dirty change earlier</li>
					<li>Filterete 1500 filters are more aggressive than the Kirkland 2200 filters (pleats are tighter)</li>
					<li>People buy more aggressive (higher MERV 8) filters thinking they are better
						<ul>
							<li>They leave them in too long (since they paid more for them)</li>
							<li>Filter is choking the furnace when you remove the filter and the furnace quiets down</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The furnace is loud because it is sucking air around the filter (when it is clogged)</li>
								</ul>
							<li>It is important to change the aggressive filters more often as they can get clogged even faster</li>  
						</ul>
