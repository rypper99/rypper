			<p>Holdings surmised based upon tweets. stated he only has 10 stocks</p>
			<ul>
			<li>CM (CIBC) - stated 13.5% of portfolio
			<li>TD
			<li>RY
			<li>NA 
			<li>BMO
			<li>BNS

			</ul>
		<p>On 2022.12.07 esitmated portfolio value at $1,322,170.  
		He said CM(CIBC) was 13.5% of portfolio and on July 28, 2022 he DRIPed 36 shares.  
		On July 28, CM price was 64.16 and dividend payout was 0.83.
		36 x 64.14 = 2,309.7 (payout).  
		2,309.76 x 0.83 = 2,782.8 shares.
		2,782.8 x 64.15 = 178,493 value.
		If CM value is $178,493 and is 13.5% of portfolio, then portfolio must be $1,322,1700</p>
		<p>System (style) he uses:
			<ul>
			<li>Every Friday X amount transferred from chequing to brokerage (X is as much as you can do)
			<li>On 30th of month, whatever position he is building (currently SunLife because it is smallest posiiton), he buys shares he can (no matter price)
