					<ul>
					<li><b>Pension</b> payout
					<li><b>CPP</b> payout

						</ul>
					<li><b>OAS</b> payout
					<li><b>passion projects / part time</b>
					</ul>
				<li><u>Cash Spending bucket</u>
					<ul>
					<li>Used to reduce sequence of return risks (i.e. forced to sell assets in a downturn)
					<li>Holds spending needs for # of years to match your comfort level
						<ul>
						<li>1 year : would be minimum
						<li>Kornel aims for 2 year saftey cushion but <b>NOT</b> 2 years of yearly annual expenses in cash
							<ul>
							<li>cash deficit = expenses - (dividends with 25% cut to assume financial crash) - (reliable income sources)
							<li>2 x annual cash deficit in HISA
							</ul>
						<li>5 year : this is a big opportunity cost
						</ul>
					<li>keep in cash, HISA, GICs, short term bonds
					</ul>
				<li><u>Dividend bucket</u>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Taxable dividends</b> - from taxable accounts (once a quarter move money to checking)
					<li><b>TFSA dividends</b> – can use (if necessary) but he tries to leave this untouched (if he can)
					<li><b>RRSP dividends</b> – doesn’t touch these (withholding tax, partial deregistration fee if you don’t have a RRIF)
					</ul>
				<li><u>Equity bucket</u>
					<ul>
					<li><b>RRSP - up to basic personal amount</b> ($14,398 each) - Optimize around Federal tax (which is higher than provincial)
						<ul>
						<li>2022 Federal Basic Personal Amount: $14, 398  <b>make sure take this as minimum every year</b>
						<li>Keeps tax shelter in-tact (to get tax free and tax deferred compounding)
						<li>Be careful about leaving RRSP alone for too long (RRIF minimum withdrawals)
						</ul>
					<li><b>Taxable accounts</b>
						<ul>
						<li>Capital gains taxed favourably
						</ul>
					<li><b>RRSP - up to lowest tax bracket</b>
						<ul>
						<li>once Taxable accounts depleted – use RRSP but don’t exceed lowest tax bracket!
						<li>2022 Federal Lowest Tax Bracket: $50,197
						</ul>
					<li><b>TFSA</b> if you need more (i.e. > $50,197)
						<ul>
						<li>If unexpected expenses in a year (over planned annual expenses)- can leverage TFSA money
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Shaun approach</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Cash (risk free investments: GICs, HISA, etc.) - needed for income next 1-3 years</li>
			<li>Income / Balanced (Active) - needed in 4-6 years</li>
			<li>Passive (Passive) - needed in +6 years</li>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Determine how much to withdraw (per year)</button>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed: 4% rule (for traditional 30 year retirement)
					<ul>
					<li>Definition: Withdraw 4% of portfolio each year (adjusted for inflation each year)
					<li>Optimized for you not running out of money vs. optimized to spend portfolio appropriately
					<li>Pros: 
						<ul>
						<li>Easy to calculate (simple)
						</ul>
					<li>Cons
						<ul>
						<li>If portfolio continues to grow (i.e. good year) – taking less than you could (die with a large portfolio)
						<li>Eg. You are 92 and portfolio has $5 million – still withdrawing $40,000 (plus inflation) – should take more
						<li>Can be too conservative (when portfolio does good) – really focused on dealing with bad years
						</ul>
					<li>Need to lower percentage if retiring young
					</ul>
				<li><strong>Variable Percentage Withdrawal (Kornel’s choice)</strong> 
					<ul>
					<li>This is Kornel's choice:  Uses: 4%+ variable percentage withdrawal (as per Bogleheads) will adjust with age
					<li><a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Variable_percentage_withdrawal">Variable Percentage Withdrawal Rates Based on Age and Asset Allocation</a></li>
					<li>Kornel supplements income from ‘side gigs’ to reduce pressure on portfolio
					<li>Pros: avoid ending up with a large portfolio you could have spent
					<li>Cons: may have to tweak lifestyle when market down
