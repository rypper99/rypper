	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>Indexes were orignally designed to be simple, standard ways of measuring market performance (benchmarks)  
	<ul>
	<li>For example, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) create in 1896
	and still widely followed but for it a committee hand picks 30 companies weighted to those with higher share price.  Made sense years ago when the
	calculations were with pen/paper but not as useful today.
	</ul>
	<p>In the 1970s, John Bogle pioneered the idea of using popular indexes as an investing strategy (i.e. index ETF). Fund holdings were determined by
	following a third-party index designed to represent an entire asset class vs. by stock-picking gurus.
	<p>ETFs like a mutual fund holds diversified collection of stocks and bonds but differs in that ETF is traded on an exchange (like stocks) vs. 
	purchasing from a dealer.

	<p>Active investors focus on <b>alpha</b>
	<ul>
	<li>alpha is picking stocks and timing market trying to outperform index
	</ul>
	<p>Index investors focus on <b>beta</b>
	<ul>
	<li>beta is measure of risk: high beta more sensitive to market ups/downs
	<li>index fund is designed to mimic performance of overall market - i.e. capture beta
	</ul>

	<hr>
	<h4>Index ETF</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>ETF tied to a specific index (a set of rules that determine which stocks or bondsd are included)
	<li>need to research index to determine what ETF invests in
		<ul>
		<li>most providers published their methodologies each to find with a google search
		<li>methodology can be complex with alot of equations
		<li>focus on the overall strategy, is it broad/inclusive or does it impose alot of rules and screens?
		<li>Researching ETFs is not easy (hard to find clear, complete info about ETFs)
			<ul>
			<li>start with fund's web page (benchmark index, annual fee, historical performance, current holdings)
			<li>check Fund Facts summary, Prospectus or semi-annual Management Report of Fund Performance (linked on fund web page)
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>providers have similar indexes.  Recently, more common to use lesser-known providers due to lower licensing fees
		<ul>
		<li>S&P Dow Jones
		<li>Russell 3000 index
		<li>MSCI 
		<li>FTSE 
		<li>Solactive 
		</ul>
	<li>indexes look at liquidity - may exclude stocks that are: rarely traded stocks or closely held by small group of owners 
	<li>will have rules how frequently it will be updated (often reviewed/updated quarterly)
	</ul>

	<hr>
	<h4>Traditional indexing ETF</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Every country with a stock market has traditional index(s) designed to track that stock market gathering stock information (such as price changes and dividend payments)
	<li>Samples
		<ul>
		<li><b>S&P 500 Composite index</b> : top 500 US companies with more influence (weight) to larger companies
		<li><b>S&P/TSX Composite:Canada index</b> : top 250 Canadian companies with more influence (weight) to larger companies
		<li><b>MSCI EAFE</b> (Europe, Australasia, Far East) - Developed markets
		<li><b>MSCI Emerging Markets Index</b> (China, Taiwan, South Korea, India and about 20 others)
		<li><b>FTSE Canadian Universe Bond Index</b> (government/corporate bonds including short to long term)
		</ul>
	<li>"cap-weighted" indexes are traditional tool of index investors
		<ul>
		<li>select largest and most traded companies and weight them by market cap (stock price x # shares outstanding)
		<li>most representative of overall stock market - i.e. "buy" the market
		<li>ususally they are the cheapest (i.e. 0.03% - 0.06%)
		<li>usually have the lowest turnover (i.e. stocks rarely sold / replaced)
			<ul>
			<li>fewer realized capital gains means more tax-efficent in non-registered accounts
			</ul>
		<li>"Capped" index will set limit how much an individual stock can make up the indexed (i.e. not more than 10%)
		<li>look for indexes providing broadest possible exposure to asset class	
			<ul>
			<li>S&P 500 is good but only holds 500 companies (representing 80% of market)
			<li>iShares Core S&P US Total Market (XUU) holds top 500 plus 3,000 mid-sized and small companies
			</ul>
		<li>popular indexes that do NOT do good job of representing asset class
			<ul>
			<li>DJIA - weighted to share price (vs. market cap), only includes 30 companies (selected by committee)
			<li>NASDAQ 100
				<ul>
				<li>based on largest 100 non-financial companies on NASDAQ (only 15% of US market)
				<li>NASDAQ poor diversified: 50% technology and 20% communication services (Meta, Google, Netflix)
				<li>17.1% returns from 2011-2020 but 2000-2002 lost 78%
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>"equal-weighted" indexes assigns same proportion to each stock
		<ul>
		<li>useful when focused on individual sector where total number of stocks is small (i.e. REITs)
		<li>not useful when index has hundreds of companies
			<ul>
			<li>impact of sector dependent on # of companies vs. size/impact of companies
			<li>ex. in Canada 5 big banks same as 5 small mining companies
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<hr>
	<h4>Alternative indexing / Fundamental indexing / smart beta ETF</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>many new ETFs uses indexes that screen by following a set of rules
		<ul>
		<li>target on "factors" - total sales, dividends, cash flow, book value, etc.
		<li>research suggests might be able to outperform simple index by choosing stocks with certain characteristics
		<li>generally give more influence to mid-sized companies that meet traditional definition of undervalued
		</ul>
	<li>more expensive than traditional ETFs (0.15% - 0.75%) but cheaper than mutual funds (2%)
	<li>smart beta more to do with marketing than empirical evidence
		<ul>
		<li>traditional indexes need to compete with Vanguard/iShares charging very small fees on billions in assets
		<li>business model to promise index-beating returns and charge higher-fees
		</ul>
	<li>common factors used:
		<ul>
		<li><b>value</b>
			<ul>
			<li>stocks with lower prices relative to their fundamentals
			<li>common measures: low price-to-book ratio, price-earnings ratios, high dividend yield
			</ul>
		<li><b>company size</b>
			<ul>
			<li>small companies have often delivered higher returns than large companies over very long term
			<li>possible reason is investors rewarded for smaller company risks:
				<ul>
				<li>more sensitive to business cycles
				<li>higher cost of capital
				<li>more likely to go belly up
				<li>more dramatic swings in their stock prices
				</ul>
			</ul>
		<li><b>momentum</b>
			<ul>
			<li>evidence when stock price changes:
				<ul>
				<li>if rise, they continue to rise for medium term
				<li>if fall, they continue to fall for medium term
				</ul>
			<li>medium term sweet spot is 2 or 3 months to 12 months
			<li>targeting momemtum will see lots of turnover
			</ul>
		<li><b>low volatility</b>
			<ul>
			<li>evidence show low volatility stocks tend to outperform or similar return with less risk
			</ul>
		<li><b>quality (profitability)</b>
			<ul>
			<li>companies with strong balance sheets and profitable businesses tend to outperform
			<li>in efficient markets, these companies should be expected to have higher stock prices (i.e. not cheap)
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>hurdles trying to benefit from "smart beta" ( or factors)
		<ul>
		<li>higher management fees than traditional indexes (usually above 0.50 %)
		<li>higher trading costs (more frequent rebalancing)
		<li>hard to research what is "under hood" to choose one (left with past performance - not best indicator)
			<ul>
			<li>value (2 funds that have varied by 12%)
				<ul>
				<li>iShares Canadian Value Index (CSV) - 50 stocks skewed to big banks
				<li>First Asset Morningstar Canada Value Index (FXM) - 30 stocks and none are 5 big banks
				</ul>
			<li>low-volatility
				<ul>
				<li>ETFs from PowerShares, BMO and iShares - use different methodologies with significant variation in returns
				<li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>value factor has been battle tested but others have shorter histories and sample size
		<li>as the factors become more widely known then their premiums may shrink
			<ul>
			<li>for example, research showed outsized returns on small-caps during an era when they were harder to trade
			<li>low-cost brokerages and ETFs have caused the premium to shrink
			</ul>
		<li>are you willing to stick with factors when they are under-performing traditional indexes
			<ul>
			<li>factors like value, size, momentum can lag market for long periods
			<li>will you lose patience after a year or 2, you might jump to another factor nearing end of its current run
			<li>
			</ul>
		<li>if you convince yourself smart beta is better than traditional indexes, you are more than likely to second-guess your decisions
		<li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<hr>
	<h4>Currency Hedging</h4>
	<p>ETFs investing in non-Canadian markets will have a second layer of risk with currency
		<ul>
		<li>if loonie rises against currency, your investment value in Canadian dollars will fall
		<li>if loonie falls against currency, your investment value in Canadian dollars will rise
		</ul>
	<p>Eliminating currency risk in Canadian ETFs
		<ul>
		<li>name includes "hedged to CAD" or "currency neutral"
		<li>they use a strategy called currency hedging to eliminate fluctuations
		</ul>
	<p>Recommend: avoiding currency-hedging in most cases
		<ul>
		<li>over long term, currency fluctuations will go in both ways
		<li>if goal is to reduce volatility and risk, currency hedging should not be expected to help
		<li>studies have shown adding foreign currency exposure tends to lower exposure for Canadian equity investors
		<li>US, euro and Swiss franc tend to have negative correrelation to global equity markets
		</ul>
	<p>Buying ETFs on US exchanges 
		<ul>
		<li>doesn't help if you still measure value in Canadian dollars
		<li>recommends buying only Canadian-listed ETFs even though management fees on US listed funds are lower
		</ul>
		
	<hr>
	<h4>Tracking Error</h4>
	<p>difference between theory of index and practice of implementing it
		<ul>
		<li>fund will have:
			<ul>
			<li>MER - management fees
			<li>TER - trading expense ratio (transaction costs)
			<li>withholding taxes on dividends in foreign markets (average 15%)
			<li>taxes
			<li>sampling
				<ul>
				<li>some benchmarks are difficult or impossible to replicated
				<li>when fund manager can't purchase holding in index so does best with what's available (sampling)
				</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>benchmark 8% and fund 7.5% then tracking error 0.5%
		</ul>
	<p>When comparing funds, not enough to compare just MER.  ETF with slightly higher MER but consistenly lower tracking error might be better choice.
