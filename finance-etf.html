			<ul>
				<li>Indexes were orignally designed to be simple
					<ul>
						<li>standard ways of measuring market performance (benchmarks) </li>
					</ul>
				<li>Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) create in 1896</li>
					<ul>
					<li>still widely followed today</li>
					<li>a committee hand picks 30 companies weighted to those with higher share price</li>
					<li.>made sense years ago when the calculations were with pen/paper but not as useful today</li>
					</ul>
				<li>In the 1970s, John Bogle pioneered the idea of using popular indexes as an investing strategy (i.e. index ETF)</li>
				<li>holdings determined by following a 3rd party index designed to represent an entire asset class vs. by stock-picking gurus</li>
				<li>ETFs holds diversified collection of stocks and bonds </li>
				<li>ETF is traded on an exchange (like stocks) vs. purchasing from a dealer (Mutual Fund)</li>
				<li>Active investors focus on <b>alpha</b>
					<ul>
					<li>alpha is picking stocks and timing the market trying to outperform index
					</ul>
				<li>Index investors focus on <b>beta</b>
					<ul>
					<li>beta is measure of risk: high beta more sensitive to market ups/downs
					<li>index fund is designed to mimic performance of overall market - i.e. capture beta
					</ul>
				</ul>
		</div>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Index ETF</button>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<ul>
				<li>ETF tied to a specific index (a set of rules that determine which stocks or bondsd are included)
				<li>need to research index to determine what ETF invests in
					<ul>
					<li>most providers published their methodologies each to find with a google search
					<li>methodology can be complex with alot of equations
					<li>focus on the overall strategy, is it broad/inclusive or does it impose alot of rules and screens?
					<li>Researching ETFs is not easy (hard to find clear, complete info about ETFs)
						<ul>
						<li>start with fund's web page (benchmark index, annual fee, historical performance, current holdings)
						<li>check Fund Facts summary, Prospectus or semi-annual Management Report of Fund Performance (linked on fund web page)
						</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>providers have similar indexes.  Recently, more common to use lesser-known providers due to lower licensing fees
					<ul>
					<li>S&P Dow Jones
					<li>Russell 3000 index
					<li>MSCI 
					<li>FTSE 
					<li>Solactive 
					</ul>
				<li>indexes look at liquidity - may exclude stocks that are: rarely traded stocks or closely held by small group of owners 
				<li>will have rules how frequently it will be updated (often reviewed/updated quarterly)
				</ul>
		</div>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Traditional indexing ETF</button>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<ul>
				<li>Every country with a stock market has traditional index(s) designed to track that stock market gathering stock information (such as price changes and dividend payments)
				<li>Samples
					<ul>
					<li><b>S&P 500 Composite index</b> : top 500 US companies with more influence (weight) to larger companies
					<li><b>S&P/TSX Composite:Canada index</b> : top 250 Canadian companies with more influence (weight) to larger companies
					<li><b>MSCI EAFE</b> (Europe, Australasia, Far East) - Developed markets
					<li><b>MSCI Emerging Markets Index</b> (China, Taiwan, South Korea, India and about 20 others)
					<li><b>FTSE Canadian Universe Bond Index</b> (government/corporate bonds including short to long term)
					</ul>
				<li>"cap-weighted" indexes are traditional tool of index investors
					<ul>
					<li>select largest and most traded companies and weight them by market cap (stock price x # shares outstanding)
					<li>most representative of overall stock market - i.e. "buy" the market
					<li>ususally they are the cheapest (i.e. 0.03% - 0.06%)
					<li>usually have the lowest turnover (i.e. stocks rarely sold / replaced)
						<ul>
						<li>fewer realized capital gains means more tax-efficent in non-registered accounts
						</ul>
					<li>"Capped" index will set limit how much an individual stock can make up the indexed (i.e. not more than 10%)
					<li>look for indexes providing broadest possible exposure to asset class	
						<ul>
						<li>S&P 500 is good but only holds 500 companies (representing 80% of market)
						<li>iShares Core S&P US Total Market (XUU) holds top 500 plus 3,000 mid-sized and small companies
						</ul>
					<li>popular indexes that do NOT do good job of representing asset class
						<ul>
						<li>DJIA - weighted to share price (vs. market cap), only includes 30 companies (selected by committee)
						<li>NASDAQ 100
							<ul>
							<li>based on largest 100 non-financial companies on NASDAQ (only 15% of US market)
							<li>NASDAQ poor diversified: 50% technology and 20% communication services (Meta, Google, Netflix)
							<li>17.1% returns from 2011-2020 but 2000-2002 lost 78%
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>"equal-weighted" indexes assigns same proportion to each stock
					<ul>
					<li>useful when focused on individual sector where total number of stocks is small (i.e. REITs)
					<li>not useful when index has hundreds of companies
						<ul>
						<li>impact of sector dependent on # of companies vs. size/impact of companies
						<li>ex. in Canada 5 big banks same as 5 small mining companies
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</ul>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Alternative indexing / Fundamental indexing / smart beta ETF</button>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<ul>
				<li>many new ETFs uses indexes that screen by following a set of rules
					<ul>
					<li>target on "factors" - total sales, dividends, cash flow, book value, etc.
					<li>research suggests might be able to outperform simple index by choosing stocks with certain characteristics
					<li>generally give more influence to mid-sized companies that meet traditional definition of undervalued
					</ul>
				<li>more expensive than traditional ETFs (0.15% - 0.75%) but cheaper than mutual funds (2%)
				<li>smart beta more to do with marketing than empirical evidence
					<ul>
					<li>traditional indexes need to compete with Vanguard/iShares charging very small fees on billions in assets
					<li>business model to promise index-beating returns and charge higher-fees
					</ul>
				<li>common factors used:
					<ul>
					<li><b>value</b>
						<ul>
						<li>stocks with lower prices relative to their fundamentals
						<li>common measures: low price-to-book ratio, price-earnings ratios, high dividend yield
						</ul>
					<li><b>company size</b>
						<ul>
						<li>small companies have often delivered higher returns than large companies over very long term
						<li>possible reason is investors rewarded for smaller company risks:
							<ul>
							<li>more sensitive to business cycles
							<li>higher cost of capital
							<li>more likely to go belly up
							<li>more dramatic swings in their stock prices
							</ul>
						</ul>
					<li><b>momentum</b>
						<ul>
						<li>evidence when stock price changes:
							<ul>
							<li>if rise, they continue to rise for medium term
							<li>if fall, they continue to fall for medium term
							</ul>
						<li>medium term sweet spot is 2 or 3 months to 12 months
						<li>targeting momemtum will see lots of turnover
						</ul>
					<li><b>low volatility</b>
						<ul>
						<li>evidence show low volatility stocks tend to outperform or similar return with less risk
						</ul>
					<li><b>quality (profitability)</b>
						<ul>
						<li>companies with strong balance sheets and profitable businesses tend to outperform
						<li>in efficient markets, these companies should be expected to have higher stock prices (i.e. not cheap)
						</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>hurdles trying to benefit from "smart beta" ( or factors)
					<ul>
					<li>higher management fees than traditional indexes (usually above 0.50 %)
					<li>higher trading costs (more frequent rebalancing)
					<li>hard to research what is "under hood" to choose one (left with past performance - not best indicator)
						<ul>
						<li>value (2 funds that have varied by 12%)
							<ul>
							<li>iShares Canadian Value Index (CSV) - 50 stocks skewed to big banks
							<li>First Asset Morningstar Canada Value Index (FXM) - 30 stocks and none are 5 big banks
							</ul>
						<li>low-volatility
							<ul>
							<li>ETFs from PowerShares, BMO and iShares - use different methodologies with significant variation in returns
							<li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					<li>value factor has been battle tested but others have shorter histories and sample size
					<li>as the factors become more widely known then their premiums may shrink
						<ul>
						<li>for example, research showed outsized returns on small-caps during an era when they were harder to trade
						<li>low-cost brokerages and ETFs have caused the premium to shrink
						</ul>
					<li>are you willing to stick with factors when they are under-performing traditional indexes
						<ul>
						<li>factors like value, size, momentum can lag market for long periods
						<li>will you lose patience after a year or 2, you might jump to another factor nearing end of its current run
						<li>
						</ul>
					<li>if you convince yourself smart beta is better than traditional indexes, you are more than likely to second-guess your decisions
					<li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
		</div>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Currency Hedging</button>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<ul>
				<li>ETFs investing in non-Canadian markets will have a second layer of risk with currency
					<ul>
					<li>if loonie rises against currency, your investment value in Canadian dollars will fall
					<li>if loonie falls against currency, your investment value in Canadian dollars will rise
					</ul>
				<li>Eliminating currency risk in Canadian ETFs
					<ul>
					<li>name includes "hedged to CAD" or "currency neutral"
					<li>they use a strategy called currency hedging to eliminate fluctuations
					</ul>
				<li>Recommend: avoiding currency-hedging in most cases
					<ul>
					<li>over long term, currency fluctuations will go in both ways
					<li>if goal is to reduce volatility and risk, currency hedging should not be expected to help
					<li>studies have shown adding foreign currency exposure tends to lower exposure for Canadian equity investors
					<li>US, euro and Swiss franc tend to have negative correrelation to global equity markets
					</ul>
				<li>Buying ETFs on US exchanges 
					<ul>
					<li>doesn't help if you still measure value in Canadian dollars
					<li>recommends buying only Canadian-listed ETFs even though management fees on US listed funds are lower
					</ul>
				</ul>
		</div>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Tracking Error</button>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<ul>
				<li>difference between theory of index and practice of implementing it
					<ul>
					<li>fund will have:
						<ul>
						<li>MER - management fees
						<li>TER - trading expense ratio (transaction costs)
						<li>withholding taxes on dividends in foreign markets (average 15%)
						<li>taxes
						<li>sampling
							<ul>
							<li>some benchmarks are difficult or impossible to replicated
							<li>when fund manager can't purchase holding in index so does best with what's available (sampling)
							</ul>
						</ul>
					<li>benchmark 8% and fund 7.5% then tracking error 0.5%
					</ul>
				<li>When comparing funds, not enough to compare just MER.  ETF with slightly higher MER but consistenly lower tracking error might be better choice.
				</ul>
		</div>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-item">ETF providers must prepare documents about their funds</button>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<ul>
