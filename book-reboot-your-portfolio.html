    <button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Step 1 - Stop Trying to Beat the Market</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Why it is hard to beat the market	
          <ul>
          <li>Past performance doesn't predit future returns.
          <li>Price of stock reflects expectations of how company will do in the future
          <li>Price is not based on currents assets, sales or profitability or past performance.  
          <li>Hard to predict future ==> Publically available information already built into price
          </ul>
        <li>Mutual Funds
          <ul>
          <li>puchased through a dealer
          <li>can have a higher MER
          <li>Free to buy (no commission fee) and can setup automatic contributions.  
          <li>If account size is small, higher fee has little impact
          <li>good for modest portfolio making small regular contributions
          </ul>
        <li>ETFs
          <ul>purchased on an exchange via a broker
          <li>have a low MER
          <li>pay commission on every buy / sell
          <li>No automatic contributions available
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Step 2 - Set your Financial Goals</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Understand your goals. Can't get anywhere if you don't know where you are going.  
        <li>How much do I need?  How much can I withdraw?
      </ul>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Step 3 - Finding the right mix of stocks and bonds</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <ul>
      <li>Determine right assest allocation for your goal and adjust as you get closer to your goal.
      <li>Bonds: yield to maturity (total return to expect if interest rates do not change) predictor over medium term.
      <li>How much volatility can you take?  
        <ul>
        <li>Equity markets between 1970 and 2020 (50 years)
          <ul>
          <li>averaged 9%-11%
          <li>7 years returns in the 5%-11% range
          <li>11 years returns less than -2% 
          <li>19 years returns with gains atleast 18%.
          </ul>
        <li>Less volatility with diversified asset classes with low correlation (ex. stocks and high-quality government bonds)
        <li>Magic of 20-80 (mixing stocks and bonds) from 1980-2020
          <ul>
          <li>100% bond  /  0% global stocks (8.6% return with standard deviation 6.1%)
          <li> 80% bonds / 20% global stocks (9% return with standard deviation 5.9%).  
          <li> 20% bonds / 80% global stocks significantly lower volatility vs 100% equities with only modestly lower returns
          </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>How much risk do you need to take?  What return do you need to achieve your goal?
        <ul>
        <li>Any money needed in 5 years should not be in stocks use HISA or GIC instead
        <li>Determine Expected return (should be viewed with a time horizon of 20 years)
          <ul>
          <li>stocks: return average of 5% over inflation(1.5%) for 6.5%
          <li>bonds: yield to maturity (total return if interest rates do not change) predictor of bonds over medium term (i.e VAB : 1.8%)
          <li>Portfolio 40% bonds / 60 % stocks expected return
            <ul>
            <li>bonds (1.8% * 40% = 0.72) + stocks (6.5% * 60% = 3.9%) = 4.62%
            <li>which you can compare to your targe rate to see if this will work or you need more risk.
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Step 4 - Fine-Tune your Asset Allocation</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <ul>
      <li>Create all-weather portfolio by diversifying across several types of asset classes.
      <li>Combining 2 or more asset classes reduces volatility but avoid adding redundant asset classes
      <li>Asset Class is group of investments with risk and return characteristics that are similar to each other.
        <ul>
        <li>Stocks
          <ul>
          <li>Canadian
            <ul>
            <li>only 3% of world market
            <li>concentrated on big banks/natural resources
            <li>no currency risk 
            <li>dividends taxed favourably
            <li>Vanguard found portfolios 20-40% Canada - reduced volatility in balanced portfolios
            </ul>
          <li>US
          <li>International-Developed (western Europe, Japan, Australia)
          <li>International-Emerging (China, Brazil, India,...)
          </ul>
        <li>REITs (Real Estate Investment Trust)
          <ul>
          <li>technically stocks that are not highly correlated to stock market
          <li>own real estate: shopping malls, apartments, hotels, commercial properties
          <li>law requires them to pass most of their revenue to shareholders (to avoid corporate tax)
          <li>provide steady stream of income that is not eligible for dividend tax credit - tax inefficient
          <li>REIT ETFS typically less than 20 holdings and dominated by large companies
          <li>fees generally higher than broad-market funds
          <li>recommendation to avoid: 
            <ul>
            <li>REITs are part of broad-market equity funds so you are double dipping
            <li>similar to adding utility/technology stocks on top of a broad-market index funds
            </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>Preferred Shares
          <ul>
          <li>hybrid - between equities and fixed income
          <li>technically stocks with a fixed dividend that must be paid earnings distributed to common shareholders (little like corporoate bond)
          <li>yield can be quite high compared to common stocks anb bonds but less potential for price appreciation
          <li>taxed more favourably than interest so appealing in taxable accounts as alternative to corporate bonds
          <li>make less sense in tax sheltered accounts (i.e. TFSAs, RRSPs)
          <li>ETFs will track preferred share index
          <li>recommendation to avoid: 
            <ul>
            <li>usually issued by banks and insurance companies but Canadian stock market already dominated by financial institutions 
            <li>difficult to understand
              <ul>
              <li>what you are holding
              <li>how those preferred shares are expected to behave under various market conditions
              </ul>
            <li>their risk-reward trade-offs have been historically poor
              <ul>
              <li>2007-2020 S&P/TSX Perferred Share Index delivered 2% annually

          <li>Government (real-return)
            <ul>government bond with its yield tied to inflation
            <li>designed to avoid bonds (especially with long maturity) being vulnerable to inflation
            <li>value get adjusted as Consumer Price Index changes
            <li>only tiny amount available in Canada
            <li>reason to avoid
              <ul>
              <li>have long maturity (into 2040s) so subject to big price swings

            </ul>
          <li>Canadian (no currency risk)

          <li>Short term: mature in less than 5 years (less volatile but lowest expected returns)
          <li>Intermediate term: mature in 5-10 years 
          <li>Long term : mature more than 10 years (most volatile but pay higher yields)
          <li>Broad-Market : 45% Short, 25% Intermediate, 30% Long
          </ul>
        <li>GICs
          <ul>
          <li>pay fix rate over term (1 to 5 years)

            <li>volatile asset whose price is based upon sentiment
            <li>touted as a hedge against inflation but many periods when inflation rose gold fell
            <li>1983-2004 (high inflation period) - gold lost half it's purchasing power
            <li>higher rate but higher risk of default (aks junk bonds)
            <li>reason to avoid
              <ul>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible-item">Step 5 - Select your ETFs</button>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p>Indexes were orignally designed to be simple, standard ways of measuring market performance (benchmarks)  
      <ul>
      <li>For example, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) create in 1896
      and still widely followed but for it a committee hand picks 30 companies weighted to those with higher share price.  Made sense years ago when the
      calculations were with pen/paper but not as useful today.
      </ul>
      <p>In the 1970s, John Bogle pioneered the idea of using popular indexes as an investing strategy (i.e. index ETF). Fund holdings were determined by
      following a third-party index designed to represent an entire asset class vs. by stock-picking gurus.
      <p>ETFs like a mutual fund holds diversified collection of stocks and bonds but differs in that ETF is traded on an exchange (like stocks) vs. 
      purchasing from a dealer.
      
      <p>Active investors focus on <b>alpha</b>
      <ul>
      <li>alpha is picking stocks and timing market trying to outperform index
      </ul>
      <p>Index investors focus on <b>beta</b>
      <ul>
      <li>beta is measure of risk: high beta more sensitive to market ups/downs
      <li>index fund is designed to mimic performance of overall market - i.e. capture beta
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Index ETF</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>ETF tied to a specific index (a set of rules that determine which stocks or bondsd are included)
      <li>need to research index to determine what ETF invests in
        <ul>
        <li>most providers published their methodologies each to find with a google search
        <li>methodology can be complex with alot of equations
        <li>focus on the overall strategy, is it broad/inclusive or does it impose alot of rules and screens?
        <li>Researching ETFs is not easy (hard to find clear, complete info about ETFs)
          <ul>
          <li>start with fund's web page (benchmark index, annual fee, historical performance, current holdings)
          <li>check Fund Facts summary, Prospectus or semi-annual Management Report of Fund Performance (linked on fund web page)
          </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>providers have similar indexes.  Recently, more common to use lesser-known providers due to lower licensing fees
        <ul>
        <li>S&P Dow Jones
        <li>Russell 3000 index
        <li>MSCI 
        <li>FTSE 
        <li>Solactive 
        </ul>
      <li>indexes look at liquidity - may exclude stocks that are: rarely traded stocks or closely held by small group of owners 
      <li>will have rules how frequently it will be updated (often reviewed/updated quarterly)
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Traditional indexing ETF</h4>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Every country with a stock market has traditional index(s) designed to track that stock market gathering stock information (such as price changes and dividend payments)
      <li>Samples
        <ul>
        <li><b>S&P 500 Composite index</b> : top 500 US companies with more influence (weight) to larger companies
        <li><b>S&P/TSX Composite:Canada index</b> : top 250 Canadian companies with more influence (weight) to larger companies
        <li><b>MSCI EAFE</b> (Europe, Australasia, Far East) - Developed markets
        <li><b>MSCI Emerging Markets Index</b> (China, Taiwan, South Korea, India and about 20 others)
        <li><b>FTSE Canadian Universe Bond Index</b> (government/corporate bonds including short to long term)
        </ul>
      <li>"cap-weighted" indexes are traditional tool of index investors
        <ul>
        <li>select largest and most traded companies and weight them by market cap (stock price x # shares outstanding)
        <li>most representative of overall stock market - i.e. "buy" the market
        <li>ususally they are the cheapest (i.e. 0.03% - 0.06%)
        <li>usually have the lowest turnover (i.e. stocks rarely sold / replaced)
          <ul>
          <li>fewer realized capital gains means more tax-efficent in non-registered accounts
          </ul>
        <li>"Capped" index will set limit how much an individual stock can make up the indexed (i.e. not more than 10%)
        <li>look for indexes providing broadest possible exposure to asset class	
          <ul>
          <li>S&P 500 is good but only holds 500 companies (representing 80% of market)
          <li>iShares Core S&P US Total Market (XUU) holds top 500 plus 3,000 mid-sized and small companies
          </ul>
        <li>popular indexes that do NOT do good job of representing asset class
          <ul>
          <li>DJIA - weighted to share price (vs. market cap), only includes 30 companies (selected by committee)
          <li>NASDAQ 100
            <ul>
            <li>based on largest 100 non-financial companies on NASDAQ (only 15% of US market)
            <li>NASDAQ poor diversified: 50% technology and 20% communication services (Meta, Google, Netflix)
            <li>17.1% returns from 2011-2020 but 2000-2002 lost 78%
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>"equal-weighted" indexes assigns same proportion to each stock
        <ul>
        <li>useful when focused on individual sector where total number of stocks is small (i.e. REITs)
        <li>not useful when index has hundreds of companies
          <ul>
          <li>impact of sector dependent on # of companies vs. size/impact of companies
          <li>ex. in Canada 5 big banks same as 5 small mining companies
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Alternative indexing / Fundamental indexing / smart beta ETF</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>many new ETFs uses indexes that screen by following a set of rules
        <ul>
        <li>target on "factors" - total sales, dividends, cash flow, book value, etc.
        <li>research suggests might be able to outperform simple index by choosing stocks with certain characteristics
        <li>generally give more influence to mid-sized companies that meet traditional definition of undervalued
        </ul>
      <li>more expensive than traditional ETFs (0.15% - 0.75%) but cheaper than mutual funds (2%)
      <li>smart beta more to do with marketing than empirical evidence
        <ul>
        <li>traditional indexes need to compete with Vanguard/iShares charging very small fees on billions in assets
        <li>business model to promise index-beating returns and charge higher-fees
        </ul>
      <li>common factors used:
        <ul>
        <li><b>value</b>
          <ul>
          <li>stocks with lower prices relative to their fundamentals
          <li>common measures: low price-to-book ratio, price-earnings ratios, high dividend yield
          </ul>
        <li><b>company size</b>
          <ul>
          <li>small companies have often delivered higher returns than large companies over very long term
          <li>possible reason is investors rewarded for smaller company risks:
            <ul>
            <li>more sensitive to business cycles
            <li>higher cost of capital
            <li>more likely to go belly up
            <li>more dramatic swings in their stock prices
            </ul>
          </ul>
        <li><b>momentum</b>
          <ul>
          <li>evidence when stock price changes:
            <ul>
            <li>if rise, they continue to rise for medium term
            <li>if fall, they continue to fall for medium term
            </ul>
          <li>medium term sweet spot is 2 or 3 months to 12 months
          <li>targeting momemtum will see lots of turnover
          </ul>
        <li><b>low volatility</b>
          <ul>
          <li>evidence show low volatility stocks tend to outperform or similar return with less risk
          </ul>
        <li><b>quality (profitability)</b>
          <ul>
          <li>companies with strong balance sheets and profitable businesses tend to outperform
          <li>in efficient markets, these companies should be expected to have higher stock prices (i.e. not cheap)
          </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>hurdles trying to benefit from "smart beta" ( or factors)
        <ul>
        <li>higher management fees than traditional indexes (usually above 0.50 %)
        <li>higher trading costs (more frequent rebalancing)
        <li>hard to research what is "under hood" to choose one (left with past performance - not best indicator)
          <ul>
          <li>value (2 funds that have varied by 12%)
            <ul>
            <li>iShares Canadian Value Index (CSV) - 50 stocks skewed to big banks
            <li>First Asset Morningstar Canada Value Index (FXM) - 30 stocks and none are 5 big banks
            </ul>
          <li>low-volatility
            <ul>
            <li>ETFs from PowerShares, BMO and iShares - use different methodologies with significant variation in returns
            <li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>value factor has been battle tested but others have shorter histories and sample size
        <li>as the factors become more widely known then their premiums may shrink
          <ul>
          <li>for example, research showed outsized returns on small-caps during an era when they were harder to trade
          <li>low-cost brokerages and ETFs have caused the premium to shrink
          </ul>
        <li>are you willing to stick with factors when they are under-performing traditional indexes
          <ul>
          <li>factors like value, size, momentum can lag market for long periods
          <li>will you lose patience after a year or 2, you might jump to another factor nearing end of its current run
          <li>
          </ul>
        <li>if you convince yourself smart beta is better than traditional indexes, you are more than likely to second-guess your decisions
        <li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Currency Hedging</h4>
      <p>ETFs investing in non-Canadian markets will have a second layer of risk with currency
        <ul>
        <li>if loonie rises against currency, your investment value in Canadian dollars will fall
        <li>if loonie falls against currency, your investment value in Canadian dollars will rise
        </ul>
      <p>Eliminating currency risk in Canadian ETFs
        <ul>
        <li>name includes "hedged to CAD" or "currency neutral"
        <li>they use a strategy called currency hedging to eliminate fluctuations
        </ul>
      <p>Recommend: avoiding currency-hedging in most cases
        <ul>
        <li>over long term, currency fluctuations will go in both ways
        <li>if goal is to reduce volatility and risk, currency hedging should not be expected to help
        <li>studies have shown adding foreign currency exposure tends to lower exposure for Canadian equity investors
        <li>US, euro and Swiss franc tend to have negative correrelation to global equity markets
        </ul>
      <p>Buying ETFs on US exchanges 
        <ul>
        <li>doesn't help if you still measure value in Canadian dollars
        <li>recommends buying only Canadian-listed ETFs even though management fees on US listed funds are lower
        </ul>
        
      <h4>Tracking Error</h4>
      <p>difference between theory of index and practice of implementing it
        <ul>
        <li>fund will have:
          <ul>
          <li>MER - management fees
          <li>TER - trading expense ratio (transaction costs)
          <li>withholding taxes on dividends in foreign markets (average 15%)
          <li>taxes
          <li>sampling
            <ul>
            <li>some benchmarks are difficult or impossible to replicated
            <li>when fund manager can't purchase holding in index so does best with what's available (sampling)
            </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>benchmark 8% and fund 7.5% then tracking error 0.5%
        </ul>
      <p>When comparing funds, not enough to compare just MER.  ETF with slightly higher MER but consistenly lower tracking error might be better choice.

        <li>Tricks of the Trade
          <ul>
          <li>watch your costs	
            <ul>
            <li>commissions
              <ul>
              <li>small trades can be costly and eat into returns
              <li>some brokerages do offer no commissions
              </ul>
            <li>bid-ask spread 
              <ul>
              <li>difference between bid and ask price
              <li>buying ===> always will pay slightly more than the true value
              <li>selling ==> always will get slightly less than the true value
              <li>example: buy 100 shares and immmediately sell
                <ul>
                <li>even if no commissions you will have less money due to bid-ask spread
                </ul>
              <li>bid-ask related to liquidity of stocks	
                <ul>
                <li>more liquid stocks
                  <ul>
                  <li>large frequently traded holdings
                  <li>have a very tight bid-ask spread (i.e. 0.01)
                  </ul>
                <li>less liquid stocks
                  <ul>
                  <li>small holding only trading few shares daily
                  <li>have a wider bid-ask spread
                  <li>a large order can move the price
                    <ul>
                    <li>not applicable to ETFs where price set based upon underlying holdings and not influenced how often traded
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              <li>generally ETFs with high price cost less from bid-ask perspective
                <ul>
                <li>if shares are higher, you are buying less shares for same money
                <li>less shares means bid-ask difference on less shares
                </ul>
              <li>not a concern for long-term investors making infrequent trades
              <li>concern for investors trading too frequently (differences add up)

            <li>large inflow to fund => buy underlying holdings on open market and add ETF shares into market
            <li>large outflow from fund fund =>sell underlying holdings on open market and remove ETF shares from market
            </ul>
          <li>only trade when markets open	
            <ul>
            <li>never place an order on an exchange when markets closed
              <ul>
              <li>at opening, can take time for ETFs prices to be updated and adjusted
              <li>so you don't want your order sent a millisecond after opening bell
              <li>pricing anomalies are most likely in 15 mins after open and 15 mins before close
                <ul>

            </ul>
          <li>avoid trading on TSX when US market closed
            <ul>
            <li>Candian and US markets closed on holidays but have different holidays
            <li>if TSX open and US closed and fund holds US stocks
              <ul>
              <li>US stocks do not reflect changes from previous days

          <li>can usually enroll online
          <li>not every ETF is eligible at every brokerage
          <li>great for TFSA and RRSP but avoid in non-registered accounts

            <li>currency exchange rates charged by online brokerages are terrible
            <li>if account non-reg, additional book keeping	
              <li>capitial gains/loss need to be reported in Canadian dollars
              <li>you need to record exchange rate on day you buy and sell

            <li>I will invest after election

          </ul>
        <li>Addition to predictions
